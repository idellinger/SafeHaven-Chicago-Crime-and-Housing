Using publicly accessible data from the City of Chicago and Realtor.com (via HomeHarvest), we developed a machine learning model to demonstrate the relationships between neighborhoods, housing, and crime.

This was our final project for the 4Geeks Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp. 

The application is currently available at <https://safe-haven.onrender.com/>
