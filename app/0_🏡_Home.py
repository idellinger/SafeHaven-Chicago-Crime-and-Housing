Our project aims to forecast the number of crimes in Chicago neighborhoods by considering different factors related to housing.\n
These include where the homes are located, how much they were last sold for, and the year in which were built.\n
Unlike typical models that predict housing prices, our focus is on exploring how information about homes might provide insights into the number of crimes in the city of Chicago.
